                In this contest, participants attempt to make as many three-point field goals as possible from five positions behind the three-point line in one minute. Players begin shooting from one corner of the court, and move from station to station along the three-point arc until they reach the other corner. At each shooting station is a rack with five basketballs. Out of the five balls, four are worth one point and the fifth one (money ball) is worth two points. A rack consisting only of “money balls” can be placed on any of the 5 spots of the player's choice, bringing up the maximum possible score to 34 points. Two additional shots are placed on each side of the top of the key, worth three points each.
